## Lilie: Header-Only Libraries for C

**Lilie** is a collection of header-only libraries for C projects, offering lightweight and easy-to-use solutions for common programming tasks.

#### Current Libraries

* **Bugie**: A simple logging library with customizable log levels, time formatting, color support, and output stream control.

* **Colie**: A color library providing ANSI escape codes for foreground and background colors, along with functions for setting text attributes (bold, italic, underline, etc.).

#### Advantages of Header-Only Libraries

* Simplicity: No need for separate compilation, linking, or installation. Just include the header files and use the library functions.

* Lightweight: Only the header code is included in your project, minimizing binary size and dependencies.

* Flexibility: You can easily modify the header files to suit your specific needs.
